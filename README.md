# Graphical adventures

This is a collection of graphical experimental writing in Javascript. The applications are written in pure Javascript and use the HTML5 canvas to render the graphics.

Its required modern browser to work properly. The code use javascript modules and classes and no transpilation is done to support older browsers.

If you have python3 installed just run the following command to start a local server at port 8000:

```bash
npm start
```

Every example is inside a src/examples/ folder. To run an example just open the index.html file in the browser.

Have fun as I had creating this!
